# Cubeiron
The printer that rose from the ashes of an Anycubic Chiron

the project is very young and makes no claims upon being superior to the original.

Project cuberiron was born because of my dissatisfaction with the initial quality of my Anycubic Chiron.

the project aims to correct ALL of the inherent flaws built into the printer designed by Anycubic, along with changing build format into a cube style frame.

The Cubeiron promises a few thing over the original, improved stabiliy, improved electrical integrity, and all of the inherent ignorantly created fire hazards removed.
